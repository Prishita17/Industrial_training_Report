Facial Expression Detection using Deep Learning

📘 Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a Facial Expression Detection System that automatically recognizes human emotions using Deep Learning techniques. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and computer vision, the system can accurately classify facial expressions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise, and neutrality.

🎯 Objectives

To develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing facial expressions in real time.

To implement preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification techniques for emotion detection.

To evaluate model performance using image datasets and optimize recognition accuracy.

🧠 Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks:

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Tools: Anaconda, Spyder IDE

🧩 System Architecture

Preprocessing: Image normalization, grayscale conversion, and noise reduction.

Feature Extraction: Use of Haar features and CNN-based feature mapping.

Classification: CNN model trained on labeled datasets to identify facial expressions.

Output: Emotion classification results displayed with bounding boxes and confidence levels.

📊 Dataset

Publicly available facial expression datasets (e.g., FER2013 or CK+).

Each image labeled with one of the seven emotion categories.

🧪 Results
